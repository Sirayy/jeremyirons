Brian Wilson is OK. Pet Sounds is unlistenable, but bless his heart for trying. Everyone knows that the Beach Boys did not hit their artistic/creative peak until John Stamos joined the band and they recorded Kokomo. 30 years later and that song is still ahead of it's time. While his peers are resting on their laurels Mike and his band of hired guns are still out there rockin' Kokomo and killing it night after night. In much the same way that Trump is making America great again, the "Beach Boys" are making music great again!
